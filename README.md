# wordle-python
Recreating wordle in the terminal with python.

Random solution words are provided by the RandomWords library, and length constraints can be set.
Guesses must be of the correct length, and the player has the option to give up after each guess.
The player is always asked to play another round, and the programm exits if the player declines.
Highscores are stored while the programm is running.
The "wordle"-title text is generated using the pyfiglet library.
